OpenBook.NET
======

A portable .NET library for the OpenBook Trading platform.

Please consider that there is no documentation (official or not) for the OpenBook API,
which implies the following:

* The API itself may change at any moment without any warning
* Most of the time spent on this library is on reverse-engineering the API
* This library is provided "as-is" without any warranty

*Note that the OpenBook website itself relies on the API, therefore while changes (major or minor) may happen, changes are unlikely to happen frequently.*

Version Naming Scheme
=====

This projects use Semantic Versioning 2.0.0:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
