OpenBook.NET
======

A portable .NET library for the OpenBook Trading platform.

Please consider that there is no documentation (official or not) for the OpenBook API,
which implies the following:

* The API itself may change at any moment without any warning
* Most of the time spent on this library is on reverse-engineering the API
* This library is provided "as-is" without any warranty

*Note that the OpenBook website itself relies on the API, therefore while changes (major or minor) may happen, changes are unlikely to happen frequently.
